# Thinkly 🧠

> **AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform**
> *Adaptive learning through personalized daily courses.*

Thinkly is a React Native application that leverages AI to generate personalized educational content. It features a cross-platform architecture (iOS & Android) built with Expo, integrating Firebase for real-time data syncing and OpenAI for dynamic content generation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **Core**
- **React Native (Expo)**: Managed workflow.
- **TypeScript**: Strictly typed codebase.
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing.

### **Services**
- **Firebase Auth**: Authentication (Email, Google, Facebook).
- **Firebase Firestore**: User data, courses, and progress tracking.
- **OpenAI API**: Dynamic generation of course content and quizzes.

### **Key Features**
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth providers and secure credential management.
- **Dynamic Content**: Personalized daily challenges generated via GPT models.
- **Gamification**: Badge system, streaks, and XP tracking.
- **Localization**: Multi-language support with context-based state management.
- **Theming**: Dark/Light mode support.

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a **Feature-Based** directory structure:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── contexts/       # Global state (Auth, Localization, Theme)
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (e.g., useAuth)
├── features/       # Domain logic (e.g., DailyChallenge)
├── services/       # External integrations (Firebase, OpenAI)
└── utility/        # Helpers and constants
app/                # Navigation routes
```

### **Engineering Practices**
- **Type Safety**: strict TypeScript configuration.
- **Modular Imports**: Path aliases (`@components`, `@services`) for maintainability.
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables handled via `app.config.ts` and `.env`.
- **Component Isolation**: Separation of concerns between UI and business logic.

## 🚀 Trade-offs & Improvements

### **Trade-offs**
1.  **State Management**: 
    - *Choice*: React Context.
    - *Rationale*: Low boiler-plate and sufficient for current app complexity compared to Redux/Zustand.

2.  **Expo Managed Workflow**:
    - *Choice*: Managed workflow over bare workflow.
    - *Rationale*: Simplified CI/CD and native module handling via config plugins.

### **Future Roadmap**
- **Testing**: Add Jest and React Native Testing Library coverage.
- **Performance**: Implement `FlashList` for large lists.
- **Offline Support**: Enhanced Firestore persistence.
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive screen reader audit.
